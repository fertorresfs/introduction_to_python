This repository provides an introduction to the Python programming language for absolute beginners. Here you will find basic concepts, practical examples, and exercises to get you started with Python programming.

# What is Python?
Python is a popular programming language created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. It is known for its clear and readable syntax, making it a great choice for beginners.

Python is used for:

- Web development (server-side),
- Software development,
- Mathematics and scientific computing,
- Task automation and system scripting.

## What can Python do?

- **Create web applications:** Python can be used on servers to create dynamic and interactive web applications.
- **Automate tasks:** Python can automate repetitive tasks, such as file manipulation, sending emails, and interacting with systems.
- **Analyze data:** Python has powerful libraries for data analysis, such as Pandas and NumPy.
- **Machine Learning:** Python is widely used in Machine Learning, with libraries like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
- **Create prototypes:** Python's simple syntax allows for rapid prototyping of software.

## Why Python?

- **Cross-platform:** Python works on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- **Simple syntax:** Python's syntax is similar to English, making it easy to learn.
- **Active community:** Python has a large and active community that provides support and resources for programmers of all levels.
- **Versatile:** Python can be used for a variety of tasks, from web development to data analysis and Machine Learning.

## Installing Python

Most computers already have Python installed. To check if you have Python installed, open the terminal or command prompt and type:

```
python --version
```

## If Python is not installed, you can download it for free from https://www.python.org/.

Getting Started with Python
Python is an interpreted language. This means that you write code in .py files and run them using the Python interpreter.

To run a Python file, open the terminal, navigate to the directory where the file is saved, and type:

```
python filename.py
```
Example (hello_world.py):
```
print("Hello, World!")
```
To run this code, save it as hello_world.py and type in the terminal:
```
python hello_world.py
```

# The Python Command Line

You can also run Python code directly in the command line. To open the Python interpreter, type python in the terminal. From there, you can type Python commands and run them immediately. To exit the interpreter, type:
```
exit()
```
